# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb) where the model for the economy is imported from [inauguralproject.py](inauguralproject.py). The model focuses on an exchange economy with 2 consumers and 2 goods. This project checks different methods in Python to solve for the optimal allocation of goods between the 2 consumers.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
