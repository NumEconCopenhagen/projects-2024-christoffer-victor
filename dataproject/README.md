# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Data Project** and is about whether different economic terms are procyclical or countercyclical compared to GDP. Procyclical is a term for when a variable grows with GDP where countercyclical means that the variable has the opposite growth of GDP. The economic terms consists of the components from the national account (private consumption, public consumption, investment and net exports) and the employment level. The data is from Denmark in the period 2000-2023. The data analysis is performed by a visual comparison with GDP and the economic terms.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. National.csv (Statistikbanken.dk - NKN1 (https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1920)) 
1. Employ.csv (Statistikbanken.dk - NKN1 (https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1920))

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install bqplot``
