# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Model project: A Solow-Swan model with endogenous growth** and is about how the Solow-Swan model changes when technological growth is endogenous. Technological growth is made endogenous through the learning by doing principle which means that technological growth is given as a biproduct of the productionprocess: $A_t=K_t^φ$. In this project we solve for the steady state value of k and y by an analytical solution and through a numerical solution. Afterwards we test the sensivity of the growthrate through φ and n. 

The **results** of the project can be seen by running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
