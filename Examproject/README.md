# Exam project

Our project is titled **Exam Project** and is about finding the optimal CO2 tax in a production economy, finding the optimal career path under uncertainty and calculating Barycentric coordinates.

The **results** of the project can be seen by running [Examproject.ipynb](Examproject.ipynb) and the production economy is imported from [Examp.py](Exam.py)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
